The coursera course on Machine Learning taught by Stanford Professor Andrew Ng served as a great introduction to the subject. The programming assignments in the course were based on Octave. We primarily had to complete in functions which were a part of skeleton program provided by the course staff.

Now that I understand the course material, I have started working on the assignments, writing programs from scratch in Python.
